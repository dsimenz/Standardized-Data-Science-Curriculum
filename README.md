# Davidson College Standardized Data-Science Curriculum
## Description
The goal of this project is to build an open-sourced system of modules to standardize the curriculum for the Data Science minor at Davidson College. The statistics and coding sections of various classes within the minor often contain many areas of overlap, which creates a lack of development for students that already have experience in the minor. 
With a modularized curriculum, different students will be able to learn from a beginnerâ€™s perspective, or refresh on old principles and develop new techniques, all at the same time. Additionally, the modules will allow students not in the data science minor to explore the principles of data science, if they desire.

## Usage
This course will cover the basic skills as well as additional and intriguing skills of data science. The point of the course is not to "reinvent the wheel" by reteaching material to students who have already taken data science courses or may know of skills from other courses, but rather to provide one location with easy access to lessons and exercises so students can teach themselves at their own pace. These lessons and exercises were designed with advancement in data science studies in mind while also trying to keep the material engaging for anyone who uses them.

Therefore, this course supports flexibility in choosing and ordering topics. Students may follow the order of modules as pre-set by the designers of the course, or may pick and choose topics that are relevant to the student's interests. Activities will be available for each module, with starter code provided, as well as answer keys to check a student's answers.
