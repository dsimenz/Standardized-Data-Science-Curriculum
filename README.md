# Davidson College Standardized Data-Science Curriculum
## Description
This project is to build an open-sourced system of  modules to standardize the curriculum for the data science minor at Davidson College. The statistics and coding sections of various classes within the minor often contain many areas of overlap, which creates a lack of development for students that already have experience in the minor. 
With a modularized curriculum, different students will be able to learn from a beginnerâ€™s perspective, or refresh on old principles and develop new techniques, all at the same time. Additionally, the modules will allow students not in the data science minor to explore the principles of data science, if they desire.
